   description: "<h2>The Best Ingredients to Use in DIY Toothpaste</h2>
    <br><strong>Coconut oil,</strong> which can help boost the microbiome in your gut (remember, the gut begins in the mouth!) and naturally prevent candida in the mouth. There is limited evidence that coconut oil might help reduce cavity-causing bacteria—either way, it can only help, so long as it’s not used as a replacement for flossing, brushing, and tongue scraping.
    <br><br><strong>Trace minerals drops,</strong> especially if you drink reverse osmosis water, which removes bad stuff from the water but also removes the good stuff too. I use Liqumins Trace Mineral Drops, which were recommended to me by integrative physician Elson Haas.
    <br><br><strong>Crushed cacao nibs</strong>. Believe it or not, the ideal DIY toothpaste would be a chocolate toothpaste, since compounds in cacao beans promote remineralization better than fluoride (and of course, much more safely). Depending on the grain size of the cacao nibs, it could be a safe abrasive to break up the biofilm — just like ground walnut shells are used to polish jewelry!
    <br><br><strong>Bentonite clay,</strong> which is a natural polisher rich in minerals that isn’t too abrasive. It’s also alkaline, so it helps reduce acidity in the mouth. Don’t be afraid of putting “dirt” in your mouth—we’ve been brainwashed into thinking that we need to sterilize our mouths with mouthwashes that remove “99% of germs,” but vibrant dental health is actually about achieving a balanced ecosystem of bacteria in your mouth, which protects us from illness and promotes tooth remineralization. Clay is actually used to clean and polish exotic cars without damaging the finish.
    <br><br><strong>Xylitol</strong> for its abilities to reduce cavity-causing bacteria in the mouth. Just don’t add too much since it’s a sweetener — too much can reprogram your taste buds to crave too much sweetness.
    <br><br><strong>Baking soda,</strong> for its alkalinity. Our teeth and mouths are constantly under attack by acids thanks to the foods we eat. Neutralizing these acids with vegetables and water is essential to maintaining proper pH in the mouth to encourage the right bacteria as well as protect enamel from decay. Baking soda has a pH of 9 to 11 (alkaline), so it helps to neutralize acids while not being too abrasive to teeth.",

   <strong>Earwax (cerumen)</strong> Supposed to be in your ears. It has a mission: to keep your ears healthy by trapping dust and dirt so that they don’t travel deeper into your ear. Having a waxy coating on your delicate ear canal skin also helps to protect it. The inside of your ear doesn’t need to be cleaned because earwax is the cleaner.
   <br><strong>Its advantages:</strong> ecological and economic of course, but also good for health. Unlike swabs, it prevents plug formation. Use it once or twice a week, to remove earwax visible at the entrance of the ear. Do not go further ! Earwax is an asset because it protects the eardrum, so keep it as long as it is not unsightly. And for the earcup? A towel passed around the index finger will suffice.",

All of us taking small measures to help reduce water, adds up to big impact! Save water! I've compiled a list of my top 10 easiest ways to save water without even trying ! Turn off the faucet: Whether you're washing you're hands, face, or brushing your teeth. Turn off the faucet while its not in direct use.<br>
    <br>1.  Keep it full: If you're doing a load of laundry or dishes, make sure the load is full! Using a dishwasher uses less water than hand washing. If you don't have a dishwasher, (like me) plug the sink. Fill it with a little water. Wash all of the dishes in the tub, and then rinse them.<br>
    <br>2.  Use a bowl: When washing produce, do it in a bowl or a tub, so you don't have to keep the water running.<br>
    <br>3.  Catch the ice cubes: Most of the time my dog gets to them first. But, if Nala isn't around I like to place them in my plants.<br>
    <br>4.  Keep a bucket in the shower: We keep a bucket in the shower to catch water. We use it to water the house plants. Or I'll hand wash my delicates in the bucket and take them out to dry.<br>
    <br>5.  Water in the morning: If you have a lawn, don't water it every day. And, when you do water it, make it count. Do it early in the morning when it's not windy. You'll have less evaporation occur.<br>
    <br>6.  Mellow: We're big believers in yellow let it mellow.<br>
    <br>7.  Break out the real plates: People often advocate for disposables; because, washing dishes wastes water. Which couldn't be more false. It takes 8 gallons of water to make one paper plate and 3.4 liters of water to make one half liter of water. Do you think it would take you 9 gallons of water to was a cup and a plate?<br>
    <br>8.  Fix your leaks: Give your pipes a good tightening!<br>
    <br>9.  Upgrade: Low flow toilets, low flow shower heads, gray water tanks, and changing up your landscape, there is so much you can do to make your home more efficient when it comes to water.<br>
    Good luck for this challenge !

   description: "Let’s be honest. It’s almost impossible to throw a totally zero waste BBQ or party. But hosting one that’s (nearly) zero waste is actually pretty easy.
    For this challenge, we will give you a few tips to make this change happen.<br>
    <br>1. Set yourself up for success by letting people know that your goal is a zero waste party. Explain what that is and give some clear guidelines. Explicitly give your guests guidance, such as ‘Recyclables OK,’ or ‘Please consider bringing your potluck dish in a washable container with a lid rather than covering it with plastic wrap.’
    <br>2. Ask people to bring their own utensils and cups for the party, you can suggest them camping tray for example.
    <br>3. Give your guests clear guidance on what to do with the various dishes, cups, utensils, recyclables and food waste. You’ll be pleasantly surprised by how many paper plate diehards just roll with it.
    <br>4. Hide the trashcan! If they can’t find it, they’ll look for an alternative and use the bus bins and compost! With this sly eco trick, the amount of captured and compostable food waste increases dramatically. Worst case scenario, if they can’t figure out where to throw stuff away, they’ll ask, and you or someone else will redirect them.
    <br>5. Build your stash of reusable party-ware over time! If you throw a lot of parties and you have the storage space, it’s worth investing in enough dishes, glasses and utensils for your parties. It’s completely ok to use and (re-use).<br>
    Good luck with this challenges, if it’s too cold to throw a BBQ party, get the tip 5 ready during the week and you can consider your challenges as done",
